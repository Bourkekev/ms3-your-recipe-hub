## Features
 
### Existing Features



#### Minor Features
Expand the sections below for more info on details


<details>
  <summary><strong>Skip to main content</strong></summary>

 There is a 'Skip to main content' link just inside the body tag for accessibility for screenreaders. The main content is not usually the first thing on a web page. Keyboard and screen reader users generally must navigate a long list of navigation links, sub-lists of links, corporate icons, site searches, and other elements before ever arriving at the main content. This is then hidden from view with the bootstrap class 'sr-only', however when it receives focus from keyboard it becomes visible, by basically reversing the Bootstrap CSS properties on focus. This is based on accessibility recommendations from https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/. This can be checked by pressing tab when a pages loads.
